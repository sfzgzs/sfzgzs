## Facts About Me -- Fateme Ghasemi
 My name is pronounced /fa'ti:m…ô/. I got my Bachelor's degree from the University of Tehran (2017) and my Master's from McMaster University (June 2025), both in Computer Science.

 
 In my Master's, I proved the WhileCC-approximability and Acceptability of elementary functions under [Dr. Jeff Zucker](https://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~zucker/). [See [defence slides](https://github.com/sfzgzs/sfzgzs/blob/d03ce1fab098469903e69d3541c146a54b1d4426/Thesis_Defense_Slides.pdf), and [incremental slides](https://github.com/sfzgzs/sfzgzs/blob/d03ce1fab098469903e69d3541c146a54b1d4426/Thesis_Defence_Inc_slides.pdf)]

I also had a talk at CCC 2025. [See [extended abstract](https://github.com/sfzgzs/thesis/blob/main/CCC2025_extended_abstract.pdf), [slides](https://github.com/sfzgzs/thesis/blob/main/CCC-2025/main-handout.pdf), and [incremental slides](https://github.com/sfzgzs/thesis/blob/main/CCC-2025/main-inc.pdf).]
 
## Currently I am:
 - formalizing the proofs in my [Master's thesis](https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/31564), in [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/). [See [Here](https://github.com/sfzgzs/whilecc-approximability)]
 - doing some photography on the side. I put some of my photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shots_by_fateme/), and some on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/shots_by_fateme/).
 - doing some Leetcode.

## Deprecated Projects
 - Experimenting with modeling and optimization of supply chain data with [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/). [See [here](https://github.com/sfzgzs/gurobi-notes)]
